## END OF SEMESTER DELIVERABLES

### EXIT INTERVIEW SURVEY
Please fill out by Wednesday, December 16th. The survey was mailed to your NYU email account: http://goo.gl/forms/sYzLdYwNWF

### DELIVERABLES FOR IDM PROMOTION and ARCHIVE
You need to create a dropbox account if you have not already done so. Let me know if you do not have a dropbox account. Both you and I can get additional space if I invite you.

Each student will provide their own dropbox link. 

Here’s a how to: https://www.dropbox.com/help/167 (There is also a video explaining how to do it later in the page as well.) A dropbox link is actually different than sharing an actual dropbox folder.
 
Create a dropbox link with the following contents:
  * title of your project
  * URL to your project website
  * short text description of your project
  * *at least* 3, hi-res images of your project (RAW preferably or 300dpi)
  * (OPTIONAL) quicktime video (for those of you doing video projects or projects that can be documented with video)
  * (for lyndsey only) mp3s of all the episodes
  


### END OF SEMESTER PUBLIC PRESENTATIONS

Wed, December 9th, 4:30-6:30pm EST
MAGNET 811 (Attendance is MANDATORY for the entire 2 hours!)

Use the project plan guidelines as a guide for content. Your public presentation should showcase your completed senior project–gold version.


     Each presentation will consist of 
     * 10 minutes of presentation and 
     * 10 minutes of Q&A 
     (or a combination thereof)
     for 20 minutes total.
